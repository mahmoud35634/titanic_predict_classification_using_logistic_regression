# titanic_predict_classification_using_logistic_regression


### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
 

### Code

Template code is provided in the notebook `titanic.ipynb` notebook file. . While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

#### This Notebook will show basic examples of:
#### Data Handling
*   Importing Data with Pandas
*   Cleaning Data
*   Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib

#### Data Analysis
*    Supervised Machine learning Techniques:
    +   Logit Regression Model
    +   Plotting results
    +   Support Vector Machine (SVM) using 3 kernels
    +   Basic Random Forest
    +   Plotting results

#### Valuation of the Analysis
*   K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally
*   Output the results from the IPython Notebook to Kaggle
